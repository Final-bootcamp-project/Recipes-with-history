# FULLSTACK PROJECT Recipes-with-history

Final project with Technigo.
We created a recipe site using Javascript, React, Redux, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Styled Components.

The user can sign up, sign in, view recipes, and add recipes.

## The challenge

We had some issues with deployment and a lot of time was spent problem-solving. With help of team mates we managed to find the bug and solve it.

If we had more time we would add more functionality, for example a search bar and the possibility to save the individual user's uploaded recipes to their profile. We have started to work on the functionality of these features, and will keep working with it when there is time.
